# Diabetes Dataset Analysis
This notebook contains the steps for analyzing a diabetes dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, data visualization, and other analyses to understand patterns within the data.

# Description
The dataset used in this notebook is a diabetes dataset sourced from a medical study, containing 768 entries. It includes several health-related variables that are important for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The features in the dataset are:

- Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient in years.
- **Class**: Binary variable indicating whether the patient tested positive for diabetes (1) or not (0).

# Steps Included:
- **Data Preprocessing** : Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Loading the diabetes dataset and performing an initial inspection using the info() method to check data types and the number of non-null values. Checking for missing values in the dataset.

- **Data Visualization** : Scatterplot: Used to observe the relationships between variables in the dataset.
(Include other visualization steps if added later in the notebook).
